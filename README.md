# homebridge-unifi-protect2

Unifi Protect plarform plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

This plugin is intended to automatically configure all the cameras you have setup in UniFi Protect to make them available via HomeKit. It requires the
[camera-ffmpeg](https://github.com/KhaosT/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg) plugin in order to provide that functionality.

This package is based on the excellent work of [homebridge-camera-unifi](https://github.com/ptescher/homebridge-camera-unifi).

# Why use this homebridge plugin?

This plugin aims to be a one-stop-shop for UniFi Protect to HomeKit connectivity. Over time, it is my hope to add motion sensors and
any other capabilities that make sense to this plugin to enable HomeKit users to easily connect the UniFi Protect and HomeKit worlds.

## Installation
If you are new to Homebridge, please first read the Homebridge [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge).
If you are running on a Raspberry, you will find a tutorial in the [homebridge-punt Wiki](https://github.com/cflurin/homebridge-punt/wiki/Running-Homebridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi).

Install homebridge:
```sh
sudo npm install -g homebridge
```
Install homebridge-camera-ffmpeg:
```sh
sudo npm install -g homebridge-camera-ffmpeg
```
Install homebridge-unifi-protect2:
```sh
sudo npm install -g homebridge-unifi-protect2
```

You will need a working ffmpeg installation for this plugin to work. Configuring ffmpeg is beyond the scope of this manual. Please refer to the
excellent documentation for [camera-ffmpeg](https://github.com/KhaosT/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg).

Finally, adding cameras requires the same steps outlined in camera-ffmpeg. Install the accessories and use the Homebridge setup code for the
camera accessories.

# Configuration
Add the platform in `config.json` in your home directory inside `.homebridge`.

If you're using a CloudKey Gen2+, you can use the following config (note the port 7443).

```js
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Camera-UniFi-Protect",
    "name": "UniFi Protect",

    "controllers": [
      {
        "url": "https://my-cloud-key:7443",
        "username": "some-homebridge-user (or create a new one just for homebridge)",
        "password": "some-password"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

If you're using a UniFi Dream Machine Pro, drop the port and use your regular Ubiquiti Account credentials. This does not support 2FA currently.

```js
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Camera-UniFi-Protect",
    "name": "UniFi Protect",

    "controllers": [
      {
        "url": "https://my-udm-pro",
        "username": "your-ubiquiti-account",
        "password": "your-ubiquiti-password"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Advanced Configuration (Optional)
This step is not required. For those that prefer to tailor the defaults to their liking, here are the supported parameters.

```
"platforms": [
  {
    "platform": "Camera-UniFi-Protect",
    "name": "UniFi Protect",
    "videoProcessor" : "/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg",

    "controllers": [
      {
        "url": "https://my-cloud-key:7443/",
        "username": "some-homebridge-user (or create a new one just for homebridge)",
        "password": "some-password"
      }
    ],

    "videoConfig": {
        "sourcePrefix": "-re -rtsp_transport http",
        "additionalCommandline": "-preset slow -profile:v high -level 4.2 -x264-params intra-refresh=1:bframes=0",
        "mapaudio": "0:0",
        "mapvideo": "0:1",
        "maxStreams": 4,
        "maxWidth": 1920,
        "maxHeight": 1080,
        "maxFPS": 20
    } 
  }
]
```
